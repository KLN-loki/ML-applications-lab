Python has a crucial role in machine learning because Python provides libraries like NumPy, 
Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. These libraries offer tools and functions essential 
for data manipulation, analysis, and building machine learning models. It is well-known for its 
readability and offers platform independence. These all things make it the perfect language of 
choice for Machine Learning.
